"""RadiologicImage class

RadiologicImage is an abstract class designed to be used across multiple imaging
modalities. It provides a unified class structure that allows easy manipulation
across modalities.

Example:
    import RadiologicImage as ri
    example = ri.RadiologicImage("MRI", "T1", "20000123", ["x","y","z"], [2,2,2])
    example.unitTest()

Attributes:
    radiologic_type (str): The imaging modality for your data (Ex: "MRI","CT","PET")
    contrast (str): Pulse sequence (Ex: "T1","T2")
    date_of_acquisition (str): Date should come from image_manifest.json (Ex: "20000123")
    image_dimensions (str): Dimensions in human interpretable form (Ex: ["x","y","z"], ["x","y","time"], etc.)
    image_resolution (int): Scale of each correspond dimension, currently in mm (Ex: [2,2,2])

Todo:
    * image resolution: should we mandate a scale, such as measurements must be in mm? (think about PET being on cm scale)
    * get date of acquisition from from image manifest

Alterations:
    TCA 1/23/19 - initialized class & wrote unit test
