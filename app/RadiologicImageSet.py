"""RadiologicImageSet class

RadiologicImageSet is an abstract class designed to be wrap around multiple instances of RadiologicImage instances.
It provides a unified class structure that allows easy manipulation across a group of radiological images. For instance,
we should be easily able to filter a group radiology image instances based on MRI contrast, date of acquisition, etc.

Example:
    import RadiologicImageSet as ris
    image1 = ri.RadiologicImage("MRI", "T1", "20000123", ["x","y","z"], [2,2,2])
    image2 = ri.RadiologicImage("MRI", "T2", "20000123", ["x","y","z"], [0.5,0.5,4])
    image3 = ri.RadiologicImage("MRI", "T1+GAD", "20000123", ["x","y","z"], [1,1,1.5])
    ex = ris.RadiologicImageSet([image1, image2, image3])

Attributes:
    *** (***): ***
        (Ex: ***)
    radiologic_type (str): The imaging modality for your data
        (Ex: "MRI","CT","PET")
    contrast (str): Pulse sequence
        (Ex: "T1","T2")
    date_of_acquisition (str): Date should come from image_manifest.json
        (Ex: "20000123")
    image_dimensions (str): Dimensions in human interpretable form
        (Ex: ["x","y","z"], ["x","y","time"], etc.)
    image_resolution (int): Scale of each correspond dimension, currently in mm
        (Ex: [2,2,2])
